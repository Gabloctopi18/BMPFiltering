The following repository contains simple image-filtering code designed for images with a .bmp file extension. 
Usage: ./filter [flag] infile outfile
Available filters:
    -y:  force symmetry (beta)
    -g:  grayscale
    -r:  reflect
    -s:  sepia
    -i:  invert
    -b [surround]:  blur
    -e [threshold]:  edge detection

This project was inspired by Harvard CS50. I used the templates provided by them in the challenge "filter" in problem set 4. Additional features were added by me.
